It was great to see so many of you down at The Crafty Squire on Saturday evening to experience the launch of this season!
We saw many familiar faces, but also those of several new members, welcome aboard!

Thank you to everyone for entering the raffle and buying some merchandise, we hope you enjoyed your prizes, including Fred G who walked away with a 2019/20 signed jersey by the team for purchasing a True Blue and MCSC memebrship by the due date.

The game itself was quite exciting, with Chelsea boy Tammy Abraham opening the scoring with his first Chelsea and Premier League goal, but unfortunately that was quickly cancelled out. A fine piece of work next from man of the hour, Mason Mount again gave us the lead but once more Norwich pulled back with a Pukki finish. We had many chance again that we floundered, but Kovačić stepped up assisting Tammy again who scored a great goal, giving us, and Frank his first win. Thankfully results against our nearest rivals went our way and despite the slow start to the season, we are not falling too far behind the pack.

Next up is Sheffield Wednesday for a midnight kick off on Saturday, and I hope to see you all there.
