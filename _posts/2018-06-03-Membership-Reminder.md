Just a reminder for some that, if you're living in Country Vic, ACT or TAS, 'with' another Chelsea fan or related to a Chelsea fan in Melbourne then you get discounted membership of $40.The latter 2 options must have one $60 paid membership.

The "Early Bird" option to be in the draw for the signed football has finished now, but obviously we're happy to accept fees anytime from now through to the start of next season.
Pay in instalments if you wish, but in ALL cases add your initials and MCSC membership number (on your card, if you don't know) along with MSHIP1819 on transactions please.
Emailed screenshots appreciated so we have a 'trail' to follow.


Thanks to those who did take up the EB option. Your continued support is appreciated.
