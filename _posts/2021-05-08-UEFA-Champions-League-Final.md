For the Champions League Final, TCS will be open through Saturday night and it will be “first in, best dressed” for anyone.

##### No ticket sales. No bookings.

Once it’s full it will be “one out, one in” and they will probably have one door that is the entry and exit. TBC by TCS.

The scenario for us (members) will be similar to the FA cup, in that we will have an area reserved.

<br>
However, there will be NO OPTION to bring a guest.
It will be members ONLY.
No exceptions.

<br>
We are running an opportunity for brand new members to buy a membership from now, up until Friday 14th May 2021.
This membership will be for next season, but will give them access to our member areas for BOTH finals.
Your membership card will be your entry into the area on the day.
If you have lost your card, you must tell us ASAP as I can post, or deliver, or hand to you at the FA Cup. The latter will be in exchange for a pint of 150 Lashes ;-)

You WILL NEED to tell us whether you are coming in or not, but NOT YET.
Once the FA Cup Final has come and gone, I will be sending out messages and that’s when you need to tell us your intentions.

We, the committee, appreciate that this decision may “ruffle a few feathers”, but it's times like this that show you WHY you buy your membership.
It only costs $45 if you buy at the EB every year.

Security staff will have the list of members (who do tell us AFTER the FA Cup) if they're coming in, along with your membership card number so they check that off.
