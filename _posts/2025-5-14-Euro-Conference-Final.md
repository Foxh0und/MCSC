Fellow Melbourne Blues,
Thursday 29th May 5am ko.

The city venue for our Euro Conference Final will be the CQ Bar.
Their management is operating a ticket event, so you will need to click the link and follow their process.

[Tickets Here](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/chelsea-fan-zone-uefa-conference-league-final-5am-k-o-tickets-1363775131129?aff=oddtdtcreator)

The venue will open at 3am.
Each ticket is just $10 and that includes a pint of Carlton Draught, Mt Goat Pale Ale or Mt Goat Cider.
Those not drinking.....a pint of any of their soft drinks available or one of the non-alcoholic beers.

The kitchen will be open for Egg & Bacon Rolls until 7am.
There is no coffee machine in the venue, therefore you can bring coffee in with you. You will not be refused to bring a coffee in.
(NFI where you get decent coffee at 4am anyway lol)

It is also a strictly over 18's event.

Hope that a decent number of you can make it in!
