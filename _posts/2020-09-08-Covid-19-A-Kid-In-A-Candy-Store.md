It's just like Roman arriving at The Bridge for the first time once again with Chelsea's transfer window this year. We are making every other team jealous, no doubt.
Havertz, Silva, Werner, Chilwell, and Ziyech... perhaps more to come.
Exciting times to be a Chelsea fan and why not join and becvome involved for the new season. 

Yes, current Covid 19 restrictions are making it hard to watch at the pub, and and we will be waiting until November it seems. 

There is still plenty of chat going on amonst members within our Facebook group, as well as the competitions we are running for the new season; tipping, Fantasy Football, lots to do.
Check our the Membership page and sign up. Get involved, stay involved.
