#### Melbourne Chelsea Supporters Club
We have our own club set up here in Melbourne that has been running, with a higher level of organisation, since 2013. That is why this website is here. It has been created for the members that get involved in our “local” club. There are around 150 members on our list.
 
<br>

**Membership is now closed for the current season but it will be open from July 2025, for the season 2025/26.**

<br>

This is also a **paid** membership and if you live in Metro Melbourne it will cost you $65. $45 if you’re in Country Victoria or inter-state, and even international. These prices include the items being mailed to you.
We have many members who have moved away but remained part of our club. There are other deals if you have more members in your family or household. Merchandise given out for season 2025/26 will be disclosed in June 2025.

## Events
We run Xmas parties, Foot Golf tournaments and other events throughout the season for members.

- **Foot Golf**: The Terry Cork cup will be played in mid to late November.
- **Fifa Competition**: A lunchtime Fifa PS4 Competition
- **Christmas Party**: We arrange a pub party, usually the last match before the 25th, and also an event at a different venue. We’ve been to the races at Moonee Valley, Lawn Bowls and 10 pin bowling.
