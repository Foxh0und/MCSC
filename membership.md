Please refer to the the [Stamford Bridge page](https://www.melbournechelsea.com.au/stamfordbridge/) if you plan to travel to London, but we do not advise travel for the 2020/21 season.


## Events
We run Xmas parties, Foot Golf tournaments and other events throughout the season for members. For this season, events will be worked around any existing restrictions with Covid 19. Hopefully held at Christmas and into the New Year.

- **Foot Golf**: The Terry Cork cup will be played in mid to late November.
- **Fifa Competition**: At The Crafty Squire a lunchtime Fifa PS4 Competition
- **Christmas Party**: We arrange a pub party, usually the last match before the 25th, and also an event at a different venue. Weâ€™ve been to the races at Moonee Valley, Lawn Bowls and 10 pin bowling.

The inaugural Foot Golf tournament 11/2/2017 with former player Paul Canoville in attendance. Now named "The Terry Cork Cup", we have run the competition 4 times since at the course in Upper Beaconsfield.


## The Fifth Stand App
Chelsea FC have the [Fifth Stand App](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/chelsea-fc-the-5th-stand/id1353142218) and you can join the Melbourne club via that forum. We'd love to get as many as possible on that list and it takes just 2 minutes to do it.

**Note** this does not give you the same local Melbourne privileges as filling out the word doc and paying us a membership fee.
