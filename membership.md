If you live in Melbourne there are **_THREE_** types of membership associated with Chelsea FC that are available to you. 
It is important not to confuse them with each other. 
They are all different and give you different benefits.

#### Melbourne Chelsea Supporters Club
We have our own club set up here in Melbourne that has been running, with a higher level of organisation, since 2013. 
That is why this website is here. It has been created for the members that get involved in our “local” club.
There are about 150 members.

<br>

**Membership will be open from July 2022, through to mid-December 2022, for the season 2022/23**

<br>

This is also a **paid** membership and if you live in Metro Melbourne it will cost you $60. $40 if you’re in Country Victoria or inter-state, and even international. These prices include the items being mailed to you 
We have many members who have moved away but remained part of our club. There are other deals if you have more members in your family or household.
We sell our MCSC memberships between July and December each year.

For 2022/23 you will receive club merchandise items that will include the regular season badge and membership card and hopefully special offers for our chosen venue in the city. Further information on 2022/23 items will be disclosed in July.


To sign up, please follow the instructions on the membership form that we will make 
available in July. Questions can always be directed at the the club by emailing admin@melbournechelsea.com.au

## Events
We run Xmas parties, Foot Golf tournaments and other events throughout the season for members. For this season, events will be worked around any existing restrictions with Covid 19. Hopefully held at Christmas and into the New Year.

- **Foot Golf**: The Terry Cork cup will be played in mid to late November.
- **Fifa Competition**: At The Crafty Squire a lunchtime Fifa PS4 Competition
- **Christmas Party**: We arrange a pub party, usually the last match before the 25th, and also an event at a different venue. We’ve been to the races at Moonee Valley, Lawn Bowls and 10 pin bowling.

#### Chelsea's 5th Stand App
Simply scan the QR code here and that will take you to the Melbourne club on the app where you can register via email or social media.
Get your family and friends involved in that too. Their App was only introduced a couple of years ago and it has grown the global following of CFC significantly in that time. You can enter competitions and win signed merchandise, directly from Chelsea FC in London.

#### Chelsea FC Membership
This is a membership directly with Chelsea FC which they are running for the next season.
However, travelling from Australia is still the bigger hurdle as the vaccinations are not as frequent here as they are in other parts of the world. If you are hopeful to get across to London in the New Year, and the second half of the season, then it as strongly advised that you buy a Chelsea membership, as the 5 bonus loyalty points they offer are only available up until July 23rd 2021.
See our [Stamford Bridge page](https://www.melbournechelsea.com.au/stamfordbridge/) tab for more information.
