#### Melbourne Chelsea Supporters Club
We have our own club set up here in Melbourne that has been running, with a higher level of organisation, since 2013. That is why this website is here. It has been created for the members that get involved in our “local” club. There are around 150 members on our list.
 
<br>

Membership is open for the new season 2025/26.

<br>

Our Official Supporters Club is a paid membership and if you live in Metro Melbourne it will cost you $65. If you have family/household  who are Chelsea Supporters too, then their fee is $45.
It's also $45 if you’re in Country Victoria or inter-state, and even international. These prices include the items being mailed to you. 
We have many members who have moved away but remained part of our club. 
Below are photos of the merchandise given out for the new season, 2025/26.
This season we have a 460ml glass, a shot glass, plus the usual items of season badge, membership card and bumper sticker.
As you can see,the card and badge theme are for Chelsea's 120 year anniversary.
