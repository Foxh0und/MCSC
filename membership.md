## Events
Every season we like to run events for our members, so please come along and check them out.

- **Season Launch**: Come down to The Crafty Squire as we take on Norwich for the 9:30 PM kick off on Saturday the 24th of August
- **Foot Golf**: The Terry Cork cup will be played in mid to late November.
- **Fifa Competition**: At The Crafty Squire a lunchtime Fifa PS4 Competition
- **Christmas Party**: We arrange a pub party, usually the last match before the 25th, and also an event at a different venue. Weâ€™ve been to the races at Moonee Valley, Lawn Bowls and 10 pin bowling.

The inaugural Foot Golf tournament 11/2/2017 with former player Paul Canoville in attendance. Now named "The Terry Cork Cup", we have run the competition 4 times since at the course in Upper Beaconsfield.


## The Fifth Stand App
Chelsea FC have the [Fifth Stand App](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/chelsea-fc-the-5th-stand/id1353142218) and you can join the Melbourne club via that forum. We'd love to get as many as possible on that list and it takes just 2 minutes to do it.

**Note** this does not give you the same local Melbourne privileges as filling out the word doc and paying us a membership fee.
