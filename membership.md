If you live in Melbourne there are **_THREE_** types of membership associated with Chelsea FC that are available to you. 
It is important not to confuse them with each other. 
They are all different and give you different benefits.

#### Melbourne Chelsea Supporters Club
We have our own club set up here in Melbourne that has been running, with a higher level of organisation, since 2013. 
That is why this website is here. It has been created for the members that get involved in our “local” club.
There are about 150 members.

<br>

**Membership will be open from July 2022, through to mid-December 2022, for the season 2022/23**

<br>

This is also a **paid** membership and if you live in Metro Melbourne it will cost you $60. $40 if you’re in Country Victoria or inter-state, and even international. These prices include the items being mailed to you 
We have many members who have moved away but remained part of our club. There are other deals if you have more members in your family or household.
We sell our MCSC memberships between July and December each year.

For 2022/23 you will receive club merchandise items that will include the regular season badge and membership card and hopefully special offers for our chosen venue in the city. You also get a club scarf, bottle opener/keyring and a bumper sticker of our brand new logo for 2022/23 onwards.


To sign up, please follow the instructions on the membership form [here](/assets/forms/2022.23_Membership_form_YOUR_NAME.docx). Questions can always be directed at the the club by emailing admin@chelseafcinmelbourne

## Events
We run Xmas parties, Foot Golf tournaments and other events throughout the season for members. For this season, events will be worked around any existing restrictions with Covid 19. Hopefully held at Christmas and into the New Year.

- **Foot Golf**: The Terry Cork cup will be played in mid to late November.
- **Fifa Competition**: At The Crafty Squire a lunchtime Fifa PS4 Competition
- **Christmas Party**: We arrange a pub party, usually the last match before the 25th, and also an event at a different venue. We’ve been to the races at Moonee Valley, Lawn Bowls and 10 pin bowling.
