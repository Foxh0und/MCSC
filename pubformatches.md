For season 2025/26 we are going to be watching matches at The Exford Hotel and also at the CQ Bar, both in Melbourneâ€™s CBD.

Both bars have different opening times and CQ Bar are just starting out with showing more Premier League matches, and so will cater to some of the obscure kick off times.

Members of the Official Supporters Club will enjoy a discount on drinks on production of their membership card at both menus.
Not a member? See the [membership](https://www.chelseafcinmelbourne.com/membership/) tab on our website for further details. 

The MCSC committee look forward to using the Exford Hotel. 

Always check our social media posts for what matches will be arranged at which pub.
