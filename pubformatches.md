For season 2024/25 we are excited to be watching the majority of our weekend matches at The Exford Hotel on Russell Street in the CBD. 

Those of you that usually make a trip in to the city will find the arrangements slightly different to previous venues we have used, unless you were around for the "Fluid Oz days"

Music will probably take priority over commentary in the downstairs bar, which may not be a bad thing ðŸ™‚, but ultimately it could be decided on the number of supporters there to watch. 
It will be up to the discretion of pub staff that night.

The level one bar of the Exford, if available, will be used for decent kick off times,and at those times, then the match commentary will be on.

The Exford have different opening hours to previous venues we have used.
When the time difference isn't 11 hours from the UK, there could be more opportunities to watch at the weird times we get.
For example, matchday one at 1.30am on Monday 19th August will be an option when it wasn't at previous venues.

Members of the Official Supporters Club will enjoy a discount on drinks on production of their membership card.

The MCSC committee look forward to using the Exford Hotel. 

Always check our social media posts for what matches will be arranged at the pub.
