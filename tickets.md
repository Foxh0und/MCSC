In case you're not a follower on social media etc., the Melbourne Chelsea Supporters Club does have the ability to help with tickets for matches at Stamford Bridge. You can be in Country Victoria, also Tasmania, to gain our help. 
There are other clubs in Australia with the same ability and you must choose your closest.

There have been plenty of stories of people paying excessive amounts for a match ticket via ticket agencies in London and also via ‘touts’ (scalpers) near the ground, but the benefit via a Supporters Club these crazy prices are avoided. You pay the advertised price. It also avoids the trouble of you going online yourself, to the Chelsea website and trying to buy, when there is a very good chance that the match will sell out, especially the bigger fixtures.


If you're planning a trip, then anyone who wants to go to a match MUST buy a
[Chelsea (True Blue) Membership](https://www.chelseafc.com/en/tickets---membership/membership). One ticket per membership.

To gain our assistance, you must also be a member of our local club.


It is critical for some of the bigger fixtures that you buy the membership before 
July 26th 2019. This will give you a bonus of 5 loyalty points, we’ll mention why lower down.


Once you have your Chelsea membership you will need to forward the confirmation to our email address, admin@melbournechelsea.com.au. Order periods for matches are usually around 50 days ahead of a fixture, exceptions for the very start of the season and for cup matches.

Once you do, you will be given all the information you need to get the tickets you are chasing.Each match has an order period where you will email us with the information we need, and also payment for the match tickets. 
You pay us, we pay Chelsea FC.


If you're only thinking about a trip for season 2019/20, it's worth buying the Chelsea membership at least. This assistance from us is not available after December 21st 2019, as that is the cut-off date dictated by Chelsea for adding members to our Melbourne list.

## Loyalty Points
As previously mentioned, loyalty points are an issue for some matches, Specificaly when playing Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, and Tottenham.
If they are in 2019, then you need FIVE points and if the match is in 2020 (which 4 of them are) then you need TEN points. 
We can advise on ways to accumulate extra points, but it is likely to be buying a ticket for a match you will not be attending. Make sure you ask us though.
All the other home Premier League matches are ZERO points needed, via a supporters club. The only exception is the last home match of the season, against Wolverhampton Wolves. Also TEN points.
Of course it is nice to try and get to one of these bigger fixtures, but we’d recommend that you target one of the other matches.

Cup matches and group stages of the Champions League will not need points either, but latter stages of cup competitions will likely attract loyalty points.
