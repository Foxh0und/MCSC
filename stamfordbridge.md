### Off to London, and plan on watching Chelsea for season 2024/25? We can help with ‘home’ match tickets only. Please continue reading……

If you are travelling over to see a match this season you will need to buy Melbourne Chelsea Supporters Club and Chelsea (London) membership.
The latter before the 19th of July 2024.
It is CRITICAL before this date if you want to try and get tickets for matches against the top teams*
The local membership can be bought between July and December every year, but as soon as you ask us for help.
Send an email to us (admin@chelseafcinmelbourne.com) for a form from July 2024.
There is also a refundable admin fee, per person, for new members. That will be communicated via email.
With your email, please give us some background information about you.

1. What is your age?
2. How long have you lived in Melbourne/Victoria?
3. What year did you start supporting Chelsea FC?
4. Do you already have the paid membership with CFC in London?
6. Do you follow any of our social media? If yes, which ones and how long for.
7. Have you been to our chosen pub to watch Chelsea on TV in the city?

Now continue reading for how “our” system works here in Melbourne:

There have been plenty of disturbing stories that tell of people paying excessive
amounts for a match ticket via ticket agencies in London and also via ‘touts’
(scalpers) near the ground.
“Post Covid” Chelsea have been using a “print at home” operation for tickets (rather
than collecting from the ticket office), and this opens up another opportunity to be
‘ripped off’ with tickets being printed more than once.
However, the benefit of using an Official Supporters Club is that these extortionate
prices, and risks, are avoided. 
You pay the members price that is listed on the Chelsea website, and we save you
the trouble of buying a ticket yourself. You avoid the hassle of going online as a
member yourself, when there is a very good chance that the match will sell out
before you get an opportunity to buy.

**It is ONE match ticket per membership.**
If you are traveling with family, friend or partner, then all of you will need a membership.

**As mentioned above, it is critical for some of the bigger fixtures that you buy the membership before July 19th 2024.
This will give you a bonus of 5 loyalty points, there’s more details lower down the page.**

Once you have your Chelsea membership you will need to forward the confirmation to our email address, admin@chelseafcinmelbourne.com
The ticket ordering periods for matches are usually around 50 days ahead of a fixture, exceptions for the very start of the season and for cup matches.

After you have joined, you will be given all the information you need to purchase the tickets you would like.
Each match has an order period and you will need to email us with the information we need to put on the application.
At the same time you will need to make payment for the match tickets.
You pay us, we pay Chelsea FC.

If you’re only just thinking about a trip for season 2024/25, it’s worth buying the Chelsea membership at least.
This assistance from us is NOT AVAILABLE after mid December 2024, as that is the cut-off date dictated by Chelsea for adding members to our Melbourne list.

If you haven’t already booked your travel, it is well worth considering what dates you are there.
In the second half of the season, the FA cup matches (should we go far in the competition) will impact Premier League matches.

##### *Loyalty Points
As previously mentioned, loyalty points are an issue for some home matches.
Specifically when Chelsea are playing Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Ar$enal, and Sp*rs.
FOUR of those matches will need 10 points, three being late in the season and the Man City match is via last season’s loyalty points so we can’t help new members with that one.

You will need FIVE points for the one match in November,Ar$enal.
We can advise on ways to accumulate extra points, but it is likely to be buying a ticket for a match you will not be attending. Make sure you ask us though.

All the other home Premier League matches are ZERO points needed, via our supporters club.
There is one other exception, and that is the last home match of the season, which is also TEN points. However that match is ManU and would need 10 either way.

Of course it is nice to try and get to one of these bigger fixtures, but we’d recommend that you target one of the other matches if you can. We can pretty much guarantee that you will get a ticket.

Domestic cup matches and group stages of any European competition will not need points either, but latter stages of those cup competitions will likely attract loyalty points.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As well as loyalty points with Chelsea for each season, we’d love you to remain loyal to the local Melbourne club and continue memberships.
We hope you’re not a supporter for ‘one season’ because you are travelling to London, and you’re simply ticking off an item from your ‘bucket list’.

The ONLY reason we can help Chelsea fans from our part of the world is if there are another 29 other supporters willing to buy the London based membership.
If they don’t, then we can’t help. It’s as simple as that.

So, on the rare occasions that the Chelsea Box office asks us to have an order of preference (when we have a large number of members going to one match, usually a category AA match) then we will determine who goes where on the list by the following criteria.

1. The length of Chelsea FC (True Blue) membership
2. The length of Chelsea FC and Melbourne Chelsea Membership
3. The length of Melbourne Chelsea membership
4.The date of when your Chelsea FC membership was bought for the season that the match is in.

Ultimately we want people to keep helping other supporters.
It doesn’t work without that.

MCSC Secretary
