**Here’s hoping for a normal season of travel to London, and Chelsea, for season 2022/23**

If you are travelling over to see a match you will need to get your Melbourne Chelsea
Supporters Club and Chelsea (London) membership organised, preferably before the 22nd of July, to ensure you have the loyalty points*. 
The local membership  runs from July to December every year. Send an email to us for a form or download one from our	
[Membership Page](https://www.melbournechelsea.com.au/membership/)	from July 2022.

The local membership is running from July for 2021/22 and details on that can be found on our [Membership Page].

Information below on this page is how the system works under normal circumstances.

In case you're not a follower on social media etc., the Melbourne Chelsea Supporters Club does have the ability to help with tickets for matches at Stamford Bridge. You can be in Country Victoria, also Tasmania, to gain our help. 
There are other clubs in Australia with the same ability and you must choose your closest.

**Please note that with the FIFA World Cup taking place in November and December 2022, there are changes to the dates for Premier League matches**
The Premier League season will start on the 6th of August 2022. Match round 16 will be the last set of matches played over the weekend of 12-13
November ahead of the call-up period for the tournament beginning on Monday 14 November.

In case you’re not a follower on social media etc., our Melbourne Chelsea Supporters Club does have the ability to help with tickets for matches at Stamford Bridge. You can be in Country Victoria, also Tasmania, to gain our help. There are other clubs in Australia with the same ability and you must choose your closest.

There have been plenty of stories of people paying excessive amounts for a match ticket via ticket agencies in London and also via ‘touts’ (scalpers) near the ground, but the benefit via a Supporters Club these extortionate prices are avoided. You pay the members price that is listed on the Chelsea website, and we save you the trouble of going online, when there is a very good chance that the match will sell out, especially the bigger fixtures.


If you're planning a trip, then anyone who wants to go to a match MUST buy a[Chelsea (True Blue) Membership](https://www.chelseafc.com/en/tickets---membership/membership). One ticket per membership.

To gain our assistance, you must also be a member of our local club (see the Membership tab).

It is critical for some of the bigger fixtures that you buy the membership before 
July 25th 2022. This will give you a bonus of 5 loyalty points, we’ll mention why lower down.


Once you have your Chelsea membership you will need to forward the confirmation to our email address, admin@melbournechelsea.com.au. Order periods for matches are usually around **50** days ahead of a fixture, exceptions for the very start of the season and for cup matches.

After you have joined,, you will be given all the information you need to get the tickets you are chasing.Each match has an order period where you will email us with the information we need, and also payment for the match tickets. 
You pay us, we pay Chelsea FC.

If you're only thinking about a trip for season 2022/23, it's worth buying the Chelsea membership at least. This assistance from us is not available after December 15th 2022, as that is the cut-off date dictated by Chelsea for adding members to our Melbourne list. Before you book your travel, it is well worth considering what dates you are there. In the second half of the season, the FA cup matches (should we go far in the competition) will impact Premier League matches.In season 2021/22 the 3rd round was the second Saturday in January and the 4th Round was the first Saturday in February. They are always confirmed FA cup dates.The 5th round was midweek, but then the 6th round was the third weekend in March and the Semi-final mid-April.

## Loyalty Points
As previously mentioned, loyalty points are an issue for some matches, Specificaly when playing Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, and Tottenham.
If they are in 2022, then you need FIVE points and if the match is in 2023 then you need TEN points. 
We can advise on ways to accumulate extra points, but it is likely to be buying a ticket for a match you will not be attending. Make sure you ask us though.
All the other home Premier League matches are ZERO points needed, via a supporters club. The only exception is the last home match of the season which is also TEN points.
Of course it is nice to try and get to one of these bigger fixtures, but we’d recommend that you target one of the other matches.

Domestic cup matches and group stages of the Champions League will not need points either, but latter stages of cup competitions will likely attract loyalty points.

As well as loyalty points with Chelsea for each season, we’d love you to remain loyal to this ability for getting home match tickets. The only reason we can help Chelsea fans from our part of the world is if there are another 29 other people willing to buy the membership. If they don’t, then we can’t help. It’s as simple as that.
So, on the rare occasions that the Chelsea Box office ask us to have an order of preference (when we have a number of members going to one match, usually a category AA match) then we will determine who goes where on the list by the following criteria.

1. Length of Chelsea FC (True Blue) membership
2. Length of Chelsea FC and Melbourne Chelsea Membership
3. Length of Melbourne Chelsea membership
4. Date of when Chelsea FC membership was bought for the season that the match is in.

Ultimately we want people to keep helping other supporters. It doesn’t work without that.
