At time or writing, June 23rd 2024.
The fixtures are out for 2024/25 and organised Chelsea fans are enquiring about ticket options.
Last season the Melbourne Chelsea Supporters Executive Committee changed the way they gave assistance to any supporter wanting help with tickets for Stamford Bridge.
Currently the same system is in place.
Each enquiry will be addressed individually and our decision will be final.
Whatever the outcome, we strongly advise you to buy a membership directly with Chelsea as soon as possible.
It will be needed whether we help or not.

Ticket only option is all you need, but if you want merchandise you can pay extra.

If you are planning a trip over to London please address an email to the “MCSC Secretary” on admin@chelseafcinmelbourne.com
One email per person/applicant.
Within your email please include the answers to the following questions. (Perhaps a ‘copy and paste’ of them so that you don’t miss anything out)

    1. What is your age?
    2. How long have you lived in Melbourne/Victoria?
    3. How far from Melbourne CBD do you live?
    4. How long have you been supporting Chelsea FC?
    5. Have you ever had paid membership with CFC in London?
    6. Do you follow any of our social media? If yes, which ones and how long for.
    7. Do you always watch matches at home?
    8. Have you been to a city venue to watch Chelsea matches?

Thank you.
