For season 2023/24 onwards, the Melbourne Chelsea Supporters Executive Committee is changing the way they give assistance to any Supporter wanting help with tickets for Stamford Bridge. Each enquiry will be addressed individually and our decision will be final. 

If you are planning a trip over to London please address an email to the “MCSC Secretary” on admin@chelseafcinmelbourne.com One email per person/applicant.
Within your email please include the answers to the following questions. (Perhaps a ‘copy and paste’ of them so that you don’t miss anything out)

1. What is your age?
2. How long have you lived in Melbourne/Victoria?
3. How far from Melbourne CBD do you live?
4. How long have you been supporting Chelsea FC?
5. Have you ever had paid membership with CFC in London?

Thank you.
