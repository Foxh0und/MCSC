For season 2022/23 the meet ups for matches, and other member orientated events, will be at the Limerick Arms Hotel in South Melbourne.
We enter our 10th season of running a proper club here in Melbourne and the elected committee decided we would try something new. There is no doubt that we have had some fantastic events at The Crafty Squire (formerly the Portland Hotel) since 2013. A one off occasion in 2012, where the relationship started, was certainly a night and morning to remember.

<br>

We depart The Crafty on good terms though, and it may well be Au Revoir rather than good bye, and the MCSC Committee thanks all the Venue Managers, across all the years, that have helped us build our club.It is not the first time we have moved venue for matches, and it may well not be the last. We had some good times at Fluid Oz and Charles Dickens Tavern too.

There is an existing relationship in South Melbourne, as club AGMs have been held at the Limerick, during winters, since 2014. The Venue Manager is also a Chelsea fan and that certainly helps our cause.

Covid and the lockdowns have certainly changed the dynamic of people going out to the pub to watch matches, and opening times had changed as a consequence.
It is important to note that this new venue will NOT have the same strange opening hours as the Crafty had before, and we shall be targeting the matches that start at 9.30pm, 11.30pm and midnight on Saturday nights. 
Perhaps the odd early kick off, if we get them, on a Sunday night.

All times will be communicated via our social media forums in the days or week leading up to the match. If you see no posts, then assume that nothing is arranged at the Limerick.

The committee is excited to start a new chapter of Chelsea Supporter gatherings at The Limerick Arms in South Melbourne and we hope those Chelsea Supporters will make the tram ride from the city, via number 1 or 11 routes, to watch some matches with us.
